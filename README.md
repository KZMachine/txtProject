# txtProject
This is the first project that I have uploaded on GitHub.
It is a program which allows the user to execute the following:

-- Encrpt .txt file: AES-based encryption using PyCrypto

-- Decrypt encrypted .txt file: Decrypts encrypted files that are created using this programs

-- Word count: I initially included a Word Counter for personal use. It was so useful to me that I decided to include it somewhere. A txt-based project seemed like a great fit!
